# PlusOne-Counter
A simple yet interactive counter web application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This web application is used for counting and saving efficiently for one time use. 
For example, Scenario 1 : Imagine you're playing a game with your friends and you have to count points.
Scenario 2: You're given a task of counting the number of people who entered the subway. This application will come in handy for you ;) 
Even though this is not one of the best applications, this is my first small project using JavaScript while learning the language!
